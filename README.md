# Face-Detection-V1
An implementation of customizable light weight face detection using the OpenCV-Python and Mediapipe package

Install the required libraries via the command line, with the command ## "pip install -qr requirements.txt"

For proper usage, run the command ## "python FaceDetection.py". It would open the webcame automatically and will perform your face detection along with the FPS.
The FPS may vary from device to device. 

For using the code in projects, we have created a class that would be performing face detection. 
For running the class, provide the command ## "python FaceDetectionModule.py"
